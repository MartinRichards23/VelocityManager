### Interactive velocity modelling and depth conversion
 

Depth conversion can take a substantial amount of an analyst’s time, often taking several weeks, or more, and still leave concerns about the accuracy and the ‘what ifs?’  VelocityManager has been designed with these concerns in mind, and offers very substantial improvements in effectiveness. This is achieved through remarkable, new interactive processes based on well proven techniques, developed in conjunction with leading edge mathematical modelling technology. The package is presented in a user friendly and intuitive environment…… “Bringing the power of advanced depth conversion technology to the user of industry standard mapping systems”.

 
### Effective and interactive
VelocityManager characterises a new generation of computer software for geophysicists which supports interactive modelling techniques, and flexible management of multi data formats. It is designed to suit both the infrequent user, and the specialist 
alike. The graphical user interface provides the foundation for implementing the interactive velocity modelling concept. VelocityManager uses the OSF/Motif interface style with X-Windows for Solaris platforms, and Win32 for PC users.

### A variety of analysis and modelling techniques
VelocityManager supports a variety of analysis and modelling techniques for the prediction of velocity models. These are based on well established ‘layer cake’ approaches, incorporating well data and optional seismic stacking velocities. Support is also offered for modelling data from deviated wells, offering accurate solutions. The modelling features a number of novel approaches for rapid solutions, and most importantly, solutions to the full potential of the data available.

### Powerful modelling features
VelocityManager offers the user the ability to integrate all velocity information with a seismic interpretation, and will allow the geophysicist to make judgements interactively on the basis of a fully informed analysis of all data available. 
Sophisticated features have been developed in order to allow the user to optimise both accuracy and speed of use in velocity modelling and depth conversion.





## VelocityManager features

### Data
VM will process and manage data types required for velocity and depth conversion.

•	Verification on import
•	Discreet project databases
•	Industry standard and custom formats
•	Stacking velocities
•	Well data, time and depth
•	Well survey, for deviated wells
•	Grid data, interpreted time horizons

### Formats
VM is designed to manage industry formats in a user friendly manner.

•	Stacking velocities in an extensive library of format types in VelmanFDL
•	Custom formats can be readily added to the format interpretation library
•	Grid files are seamlessly linked to CPS, Z-MAP, Kingdom, Petrel and EarthVision

•	Weighting for wells; individually or by area
•	Real time optimisation of both linear and non linear velocity functions
•	Optimised regression options include least squares and linear fitting
•	Extensive range of interactive quality control tools for model characteristics

### Stacking velocity data Modelling
Stacking (NMO) velocities are ‘keyed’ automatically to the user’s interpreted time horizon grids and output interval velocities between the interpreted horizons.

•	Keying to time grid data
•	Processing of noisy interval velocity fields
•	Tie velocity fields to well control
•	Interval velocity QC display

### Grid Processing

### Grid-to-well calibration
Allows the tying of grids to well control data. Exploiting SurfaSe routines, it delivers a very high performance solution.

•	Time grids to well times
•	Interval velocities from stacking velocities, tied to well interval velocity control points

### Depth conversion
Very rapid and automated depth conversion of time grids, following the building of velocity models within in VM.

•	Wells by function
